# Code for my Senior Thesis

I'm writing a thesis on adaptive dynamics. 

This is my code. It runs stochastic evolutionary dynamics on the reactive and memory-one strategy spaces. 

I include the functions which are used to run the dynamics in Julia, and the functions I used to plot the dynamics in R.
